# Bear TOC

> Makes TOC in Bear Notes:  

**Install Workflow: [Bear TOC](https://workflow.is/workflows/ddb1a11c576d4013a9e367f192c618fc)**

*See also: [Bear Power Pack](https://github.com/rovest/Bear-Power-Pack/blob/master/README.md)*

### Features
- Input text from Bear TXT file export
	(TXT export is roundtrip safe, while md loses image links!)
- Opens result in a new Bear note
- Note title not included in TOC
- Use <!--TOC--> to merge with text,
- Or paste TOC manually.
- As bullet or numbered lists
- Optional HTML links
- On Mac use [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com) that works very well with Bear and has a more advanced TOC function (uses same <!--TOC--> tag).
