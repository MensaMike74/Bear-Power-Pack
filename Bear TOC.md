# Bear TOC

Makes TOC in Bear Notes on iOS as bullet or number list, with or without HTML links.

**Install Workflow: [Bear TOC](https://workflow.is/workflows/0ebf0876498f47feb60cc1426e7fa5b8)**

*See also: [Bear Power Pack](https://github.com/rovest/Bear-Power-Pack/blob/master/README.md)*

### Features
- Input text from Bear TXT file export
	(TXT export is roundtrip safe, while md loses image links!)
- Opens result in a new Bear note
- Note title not included in TOC
- Use <!--TOC--> to merge with text,
- Or paste TOC manually.
- As bullet or numbered lists
- Optional with HTML links
- Delete or reapply TOC to edited “toc’ed” note, or use from original as a last step before publish.
- On Mac you can use [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com) that works very well with Bear and has a more advanced TOC function (uses same <!--TOC--> tag).
