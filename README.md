# Bear Power Pack

> *On GitHub: [Bear Power Pack](https://github.com/rovest/Bear-Power-Pack/blob/master/README.md)*  

A collection of workflows enhancing Bear writer app on iOS and Mac.

Bear has a great implementation of export formats, x-callback-urls, and iOS Workflow.app integration, making extension like these possible.

Hope these workflows can be useful examples and inspire to more workflows. Hopefully some of them will come as Bear in-app features – in-the future …
